<h1>About Me</h1>


<p> Hi! Iâ€™m Ansh Rajput, a 3rd-year Software Engineering Co-op Student at the University of Alberta, passionate about turning code into real-world impact â€” whether thatâ€™s through full-stack applications, game development, or embedded systems.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my skills at ICICI Lombard and Indraprastha Systemcert Pvt. Ltd, where I conducted in-depth research, analyzed key stakeholders, and contributed to the refinement of targeted policies. As a Quality Management Intern, I led audits, streamlined technical documentation, and ensured compliance with training standards â€” reinforcing my strengths in process improvement and operational efficiency.

Alongside my academic and co-op journey, Iâ€™m actively building in full-stack web development, game development, and hardware-software integration. I love solving problems that blend creativity with logic â€” especially in C++, Python, JavaScript, and Unreal Engine. </p>

<p> ðŸ’» As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I build intuitive, scalable apps using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL. I'm also exploring Web3 and decentralized apps, pushing my development skills into the future of the web. </p>

<p> ðŸŽ® As a gamer-turned-builder, I bring a unique lens to software engineering: strategic thinking, real-time systems insight, and a deep understanding of interactive user experiences. My goal is to create systems and games that are not only functional but immersive, engaging, and fun. </p>
